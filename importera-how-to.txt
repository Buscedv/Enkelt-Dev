importera module_name

Where module_name is the name of an enkelt (.e) file without the path or .e file extension. This file must be located either in the same directory as the code importing it or in the Enkelt-Dev bib directory which will be used to store installed libraries.

After importing a module, its functions can be called by writing module_name.function_name() e.g.

To import the importtest module found in bib/importtest.e and call its function test($x) (which prints $x) you would write:

importera importtest

importtest.test(message_to_print)
